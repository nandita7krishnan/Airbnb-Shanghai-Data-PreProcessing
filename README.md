Aim

The data is sourced from the Inside Airbnb website.  Inside Airbnb gathers Airbnb listing data for many major cities across the world. http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

Process
--

1. SEMMA(Sample-Explore-Modify-Model-Assess) approach was used to pre-process the data.
2. Missing values were handled by deletion and imputation, as appropriate.
3. Outliers were analysed with a business sense, and treated as appropriate, by techniques like transformation and imputation. Unnecessary rows were deleted.
4. Variable selection was done using co-relation checks with the target variable.
5. Binning/Dummy variables were created as necessary.
6. Model complexity was reduced by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis.
